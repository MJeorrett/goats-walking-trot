# Goats Walking Trot
A simple app exploring an idea for writing [GWTs](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/gwt/) in a nested editor.

The main things I wanted to try out were:
- The new redux-starter-kit library which is now [@reduxjs/tool-kit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit).
- The css [position: sticky](https://css-tricks.com/position-sticky-2/) attribute.

## Running
This app was templated with create-react-app.  You can run it by running `yarn install` followed by `yarn start` in the root directory.  This should start the app on http://localhost:3000/ and automatically open it in your browser.

Create a few Givens containing whens & thens so that you fill the height of the page.  You will then see the nested scrolling effect that I was going for.
